		  <h1>Wonderful Arguments</h1>
<p>I can clearly remember shocking some of my employees several years ago, at a team-building exercise, when I divulged the closely-held secret that managers often &#8220;make things up.&#8221; This clearly went against their view that manager&#8217;s roles are tightly scripted, and allow for no variation. The truth is that, whether your organization is more akin to a production of Shakespeare or a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Altman">Robert Altman</a> film, there is alway some room for interpretation and improvisation, if only because, in every situation, whether in business or art, there is opportunity for multiple perspectives on a subject. </p>

<p>I was happy to see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Bezos">Jeff Bezos</a>, founder and CEO of <a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon.com</a>, say <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3289-some-advice-from-jeff-bezos">something similar</a> recently, as quoted by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Fried">Jason Fried</a>, of <a href="http://37signals.com/">37Signals</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He [Jeff Bezos] said people who were right a lot of the time <em>were people who often changed their minds</em>. He doesn&#8217;t think consistency of thought is a particularly positive trait. It&#8217;s perfectly healthy &#8212; encouraged, even &#8212; to have an idea tomorrow that contradicted your idea today. </p>

<p>He&#8217;s observed that the smartest people are constantly revising their understanding, reconsidering a problem they thought they&#8217;d already solved. They&#8217;re open to new points of view, new information, new ideas, contradictions, and challenges to their own way of thinking. </p>

<p>This doesn&#8217;t mean you shouldn&#8217;t have a well formed point of view, but it means you should consider your point of view as temporary. </p>

<p>What trait signified someone who was <em>wrong</em> a lot of the time? Someone obsessed with details that only support one point of view. If someone can&#8217;t climb out of the details, and see the bigger picture from multiple angles, they&#8217;re often wrong most of the time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This fits in well with remarks made by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs_">Steve Jobs</a> in an <a href="http://thesmallwave.com/ideas-not-hierarchy-on-steve-jobs-supposedly">interview</a> with journalist <a href="http:en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Mossberg_">Walt Mossberg</a> in 2010: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jobs: What I do all day is meet with teams of people and work on ideas and solve problems to make new products, to make new marketing programs, whatever it is. </p>

<p>Mossberg: And are people willing to tell you you&#8217;re wrong? </p>

<p>Jobs: (laughs) Yeah. </p>

<p>Mossberg: I mean, other than snarky journalists, I mean people that work for&#8230;. </p>

<p>Jobs: Oh, yeah, no we have wonderful arguments. </p>

<p>Mossberg: And do you win them all? </p>

<p>Jobs: Oh no I wish I did. No, you see you can&#8217;t. If you want to hire great people and have them stay working for you, you have to let them make a lot of decisions and you have to, you have to be run by ideas, not hierarchy. The best ideas have to win, otherwise good people don&#8217;t stay. </p>

<p>Mossberg: But you must be more than a facilitator who runs meetings. You obviously contribute your own ideas. </p>

<p>Jobs: I contribute ideas, sure. Why would I be there if I didn&#8217;t? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jobs&#8217; comments are enlightening, because the idea of having &#8220;wonderful arguments&#8221; often strikes people as unsettling. Again, though, it comes back to one&#8217;s view of leadership. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>If you see leadership as just an implementation of corporate hierarchy, of a command and control delegation of authority, then the idea of arguing with your boss sounds wrong-headed at best, and career-limiting at worst. </p></li>
<li><p>Alternatively, if one views an argument as a clash between two fundamentally different worldviews, two different camps whose core beliefs are irreconcilable, then arguments seem like wastes of energy at best, and naked displays of aggression at worst. </p></li>
<li><p>And if one sees arguments as gentlemanly debates that require an authority figure to serve as moderator, to ensure a level playing field for the competition, then a manager&#8217;s role will necessarily be constrained to facilitation, and the resulting exchange is likely to be somewhat sterile, focused more on observation of the rules than on production of the best possible business outcome.  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>It is only when we see &#8220;arguments&#8221; as opportunities to voice divergent perspectives, to share new facts and data, to offer fresh opinions, to change one&#8217;s own mind as well as another&#8217;s, and to make the best possible decisions for the business, that we begin to see these forms of discourse as necessities within any living, growing, thriving organization. </p>

<p>This is one reason why I welcome both strong emotions and humor in the workplace, so long as they arise out of intelligent and informed discussion concerning relevant business issues. Strong emotions in such a situation are an indication of engagement with the business and its goals, whereas flat emotions are most often an indication of emotional distance and disengagement. And humor in such a situation most authentically arises from the sudden perception of sharply differing perspectives on an issue at hand. </p>

<p>But how does one foster &#8220;wonderful&#8221; arguments? As an organizational leader, I&#8217;ve found that it&#8217;s important to model and encourage all of the following attributes and behaviors. </p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>A genuine humility about one&#8217;s own opinions</strong> &#8212; As Bezos suggests, it&#8217;s important for everyone to have a well-formed position, but also to be open to new perspectives, facts and opinions, and to avoid becoming permanently attached to any particular stance. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>A healthy intellectual curiosity</strong> &#8212; The world is a strange and wonderful place, and even the best minds are constantly learning more about it, and always eager to learn more. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>An authentic appreciation for a rich diversity of perspectives</strong> &#8212; For me, this includes an appreciation of many dimensions of diversity, but must be more than a shallow &#8220;live and let live&#8221; acceptance of differences in the workplace. I&#8217;ve found Ken Wilber&#8217;s work to be an invaluable aid in this regard. As Wilber is fond of saying, &#8220;Everyone has some important pieces of the truth,&#8221; and his classifications of developmental levels and quadrants of consciousness have often helped me recognize the validity of perspectives other than my own held by family, friends and coworkers.     </p></li>
<li><p><strong>A desire to draw out opposing facts, opinions and perspectives, rather than a desire to suppress or overcome them</strong> &#8212; In conversational terms, this means that phrases like <em>Tell me more about why you hold that position</em> and <em>This is the way I see it, but tell me what I may be missing</em> appear as often as <em>This is what I think</em> and <em>Here&#8217;s why I think it</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Attack of positions, not of people</strong> &#8212; In any good argument, those involved will support some positions with facts, ideas and logic, and attack others using those same tools. This is part of the give and take of reasoned, passionate, focused discussion. But be sure not to attack the people themselves, and instead to support all the people involved equally. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Advancing the discussion vs. winning the argument</strong> &#8212; A good argument is one in which the players are gradually uncovering new facts, opinions and perspectives, and gradually achieving understanding and respect for each other&#8217;s positions. This sort of argument is constantly moving forward, with each contribution building on previous ones. If an arguments gets stuck, with one or more participants repeating the same points made previously, or if a participant starts using a point as a bludgeon, to coerce instead of enlighten, then these are signs that the wrong sort of argument is emerging. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Natural closure</strong> &#8212; Just as good arguments are constantly advancing, such arguments eventually reach a natural state of closure. This may take the form of consensus on a decision, agreement on additional information or opinions that are needed before a decision can be made, or respectful disagreement, followed by a decision made by majority rule or by the senior leader of the group. But whatever form it takes, and no matter how convoluted the path that brought you there, the participants should share a sense that the discussion has reached a natural conclusion that clearly followed from the preceding discussion. Just as any good story should have a beginning, a middle and an end, good arguments should follow this same three-act model. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conversations about conversations</strong> &#8212; Most of your conversations will naturally focus on particular business decisions to be made. But at least occasionally it is good to have open discussions about conversational styles, about the ways coworkers engage with one another as part of the work of the organization.  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>So remember, at whatever level of the organization you are working, there is ample room for interpretation, improvisation and even outright composition, which means there are things worth arguing over. And any argument worth having is worth having well.  </p>
