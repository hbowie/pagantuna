Design	Eric Abrahamson and David H. Freeman	A Perfect Mess: The Hidden Benefits of Disorder	3	Book	Copyright	2006	0316114758	Keep Creating throughout the Construction Process	<p> As it turns out, Gehry is concerned not with the precise angles or dimensions of a building, but with the emotional impression it instills in observers and inhabitants. The ability to convey this impression is elusive and fragile, he maintains, and can easily be lost in the neat, unambiguous precision of a two-dimensional drawing. </p> <p> To capture the building's intended emotional content, Gehry maintains, everyone working on the building should keep creating throughout the construction process. Withholding blueprints is a way of making sure that happens. Forgoing a detailed plan is disruptive it creates convolution, making a neat and well-defined process messy. </p>	Eric Abrahamson and David H.

If, in doing so, he should arrive at goals that differ from those developed by others, he will have done so under conditions of openness, trust and risk-taking. The individual would therefore feel free to discuss his differences openly with the group. Moreover, if the individual is in a subordinate power position, and if he feels he had adequate opportunity to dissuade the group and that the group publicly confronted and tested all differences, then the individual will probably be motivated to work toward the group goal but still be motivated to generate new information that may change the group's decision. This means that one can be externally committed to a decision and internally committed to the decision-making processes that produced the decision yet simultaneously monitor the consequences of the decision thoroughly to seek new, valid information to reconfront the decision without being considered disloyal.

But, taken figuratively, the words can be made to yield a sense in which they mark one of the deepest differences which divide writers and thinkers, and, it may be, human beings in general. For there exists a great chasm between those, on one side, who relate everything to a single central vision, one system less or more coherent or articulate, in terms of which they understand, think and feel&#8212;a single, universal, organizing principle in terms of which alone all that they are and say has significance&#8212;and, on the other side, those who pursue many ends, often unrelated and even contradictory. </p>						2008-02-29T10:17:09-08:00		19				isaiah-berlin	Isaiah_Berlin	Berlin, Isaiah	Isaiah <strong>Berlin</strong>	unity.html	unity.html	the <span class='sourcetype'>Book</span> <cite class='majortitle'>The Hedgehog and the Fox</cite>, <span class='datepublished'>1953</span>, ISBN&nbsp;<a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1566630193/portablewisdo-20' class='isbn'>1566630193</a>

This is called the balance, or mutual check, in our Constitution. </p>						2011-04-22T06:06:37-07:00		55				g-k-chesterton	G._K._Chesterton	Chesterton, G. K.	G.

Process	Steve Jobs	Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview	3	Interview				It's Content	<p> People get confused... companies get confused. When they start getting bigger they want to replicate their initial success. And a lot of them think, well somehow there's some magic in the process of how that success was created. So they start to try to institutionalize process across the company. And before very long, people get very confused that the process is the content. That's ultimately the downfall of IBM. IBM has the best process people in the world. They just forgot about the content. And that's a little what happened at Apple too [which led to the Apple Lisa, a market failure in the 1980s]. We had a lot of people who were great at management process, they just didn't have a clue as to the content. In my career, I've found that the best people are the ones that really understand the content &#8212; and they are a pain in the butt to manage, but you put up with it because they are so great at the content. That's what makes good products: it's not process, it's content. </p>		http://www.magpictures.com/stevejobsthelostinterview/		http://www.magpictures.com/stevejobsthelostinterview/		2012-12-20T18:35:09-08:00		271				steve-jobs	Steve_Jobs	Jobs, Steve	Steve <strong>Jobs</strong>	process.html	process.html	the <span class='sourcetype'>Interview</span> <cite class='majortitle'><a href='http://www.magpictures.com/stevejobsthelostinterview/' rel='source'>Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview</a></cite>

No, you see you can't. If you want to hire great people and have them stay working for you, you have to let them make a lot of decisions and you have to, you have to be run by ideas, not hierarchy.

Reading	C. S.

We realize it best when we talk with an unliterary friend. He may be full of goodness and good sense but he inhabits a tiny world. In it, we should be suffocated. The man who is contented to be only himself, and therefore less a self, is in prison. My own eyes are not enough for me, I will see through those of others. Reality, even seen through the eyes of many, is not enough. I will see what others have invented. Even the eyes of all humanity are not enough. I regret that the brutes cannot write books. Very gladly would I learn what face things present to a mouse or a bee; more gladly still would I perceive the olfactory world charged with all the information and emotion it carries for a dog. </p>						2014-12-06T13:20:17-08:00		308				c-s-lewis	C._S._Lewis	Lewis, C.

The man who is contented to be only himself, and therefore less a self, is in prison. My own eyes are not enough for me, I will see through those of others. Reality, even seen through the eyes of many, is not enough. I will see what others have invented. Even the eyes of all humanity are not enough. I regret that the brutes cannot write books. Very gladly would I learn what face things present to a mouse or a bee; more gladly still would I perceive the olfactory world charged with all the information and emotion it carries for a dog. </p>						2014-12-06T13:20:17-08:00		308				c-s-lewis	C._S._Lewis	Lewis, C.

Lean	Jeffrey Liker and Michael Hoseus	Toyota Culture: The Heart and Soul of The Toyota Way	3	Book	Copyright	2008	0071492178	My conscience got the best of me	<p> As a new group leader, I was sent to Tsutsumi to spend a month getting an appreciation of working on the line and mastering one process. The team leaders told us no one would be able to complete the whole job by the end of the month, but I was determined to prove them wrong. I was installing liners underneath the wheel well when my air gun slipped, and the driver bit scratched the paint on the inner lip of the wheel well. I gasped and looked around &#8212; no one saw me do it &#8212; but they had told me to pull the andon (rope) cord if I made or caught any defect. It was my moment of truth. My first reaction was to let it go. No one would probably see the scratch anyway, and no one would know that I made it. But my conscience got the best of me, and I wanted to see if the really meant what they said about admitting mistakes. So I pulled the andon and the team leader came to fix the problem and showed me how to hold the bit with a free finger in order to stabilize it better: But he did not seem angry at me for making the scratch. </p> <p> Then at break we gathered for our afternoon group meeting where the group leader gave out information on safety and quality issues and heard back concerns from the members. </p> <p> They spoke Japanese so I could not understand what they were saying until I heard the words, &#8220;Mike-san.&#8221; Well that got my attention so I listened carefully...more Japanese and then &#8220;scratchee scratchee&#8221; ...and then more Japanese. So here it was; finally I was going to get called out for messing up and they were going to do it in front of everyone. Then, all of a sudden, the whole group looked at me and clapped and smiled and patted my back and shook my hand as they headed back to the line. I couldn't believe it, after double checking with an interpreter just to make sure, they were applauding me because I made a mistake and admitted it. I felt like a million bucks, and guess what I did the next time I made a mistake? </p>	McGraw-Hill					2012-10-26T04:11:44-07:00		267	McGraw-Hill	New York	27-28	jeffrey-liker-and-michael-hoseus	Jeffrey_Liker_and_Michael_Hoseus	Liker, Jeffrey and Hoseus, Michael	Jeffrey <strong>Liker</strong> and Michael <strong>Hoseus</strong>	lean.html	lean.html	the <span class='sourcetype'>Book</span> <cite class='majortitle'>Toyota Culture: The Heart and Soul of The Toyota Way</cite>, <span class='city'>New York</span>: <span class='publisher'>McGraw-Hill</span>, <span class='datepublished'>2008</span>, pages&nbsp;<span class='pages'>27-28</span>, ISBN&nbsp;<a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0071492178/portablewisdo-20' class='isbn'>0071492178</a> 	<span class='rights'>Copyright</span> &copy; <span class='datepublished'>2008</span> by <span class='rightsowner'>McGraw-Hill</span>

Equal treatment was one motivation, at least at the start, but it was also an effort to make programming a more structured discipline like hardware engineering. Looking back, [David] Sayre observed that the Bald Peak conference had the regrettable effect of beginning a management mentality that served to &#8220;rigidify&#8221; programming at IBM. In the early days, he recalled that programming at IBM had an informal Silicon Valley flavor, which tended to encourage innovation. By the late 1960s, the working environment had become much more regimented. The disciplines of hardware engineering fit uneasily in the more ethereal realm of software. &#8220;Software is a much more plastic object than hardware,&#8221; Sayre said. &#8220;You whip it up, squeeze it, and you can dream.&#8221; </p>	Steve Lohr					2010-07-18T18:49:57-07:00		144	Basic Books	New York		steve-lohr	Steve_Lohr	Lohr, Steve	Steve <strong>Lohr</strong>	software-development.html	software-development.html	the <span class='sourcetype'>Book</span> <cite class='majortitle'>Go To</cite>, <span class='city'>New York</span>: <span class='publisher'>Basic Books</span>, <span class='datepublished'>2001</span>, ISBN&nbsp;<a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0465042252/portablewisdo-20' class='isbn'>0465042252</a> 	<span class='rights'>Copyright</span> &copy; <span class='datepublished'>2001</span> by <span class='rightsowner'>Steve Lohr</span>

The disciplines of hardware engineering fit uneasily in the more ethereal realm of software. &#8220;Software is a much more plastic object than hardware,&#8221; Sayre said. &#8220;You whip it up, squeeze it, and you can dream.&#8221; </p>	Steve Lohr					2010-07-18T18:49:57-07:00		144	Basic Books	New York		steve-lohr	Steve_Lohr	Lohr, Steve	Steve <strong>Lohr</strong>	pagan-tuna.html	pagan-tuna.html	the <span class='sourcetype'>Book</span> <cite class='majortitle'>Go To</cite>, <span class='city'>New York</span>: <span class='publisher'>Basic Books</span>, <span class='datepublished'>2001</span>, ISBN&nbsp;<a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0465042252/portablewisdo-20' class='isbn'>0465042252</a> 	<span class='rights'>Copyright</span> &copy; <span class='datepublished'>2001</span> by <span class='rightsowner'>Steve Lohr</span>

Thought	Bertrand Russell	Is There A God?	3	Essay		1952		The Celestial Teapot	<p> Many orthodox people speak as though it were the business of skeptics to disprove received dogmas rather than of dogmatics to prove them. This is, of course, a mistake. If I were to suggest that between the Earth and Mars there is a china teapot revolving about the sun in an elliptical orbit, nobody would be able to disprove my assertion provided I were careful to add that the teapot is too small to be revealed even by our most powerful telescopes. But if I were to go on to say that, since my assertion cannot be disproved, it is intolerable presumption on the part of human reason to doubt it, I should rightly be thought to be talking nonsense. If, however, the existence of such a teapot were affirmed in ancient books, taught as the sacred truth every Sunday, and instilled into the minds of children at school, hesitation to believe in its existence would become a mark of eccentricity and entitle the doubter to the attentions of the psychiatrist in an enlightened age or of the Inquisitor in an earlier time. </p>						2007-09-08T10:21:56-07:00		193				bertrand-russell	Bertrand_Russell	Russell, Bertrand	Bertrand <strong>Russell</strong>	thought.html	thought.html	the <span class='sourcetype'>Essay</span> <cite class='majortitle'>Is There A God?</cite>, <span class='datepublished'>1952</span>

Pagan Tuna	Bertrand Russell	Is There A God?	3	Essay		1952		The Celestial Teapot	<p> Many orthodox people speak as though it were the business of skeptics to disprove received dogmas rather than of dogmatics to prove them. This is, of course, a mistake. If I were to suggest that between the Earth and Mars there is a china teapot revolving about the sun in an elliptical orbit, nobody would be able to disprove my assertion provided I were careful to add that the teapot is too small to be revealed even by our most powerful telescopes. But if I were to go on to say that, since my assertion cannot be disproved, it is intolerable presumption on the part of human reason to doubt it, I should rightly be thought to be talking nonsense.

It begins with the idea that work can be meaningful and stretches it to the point where there is no meaning outside work.

Business	Matthew Stewart	The Management Myth: Why the Experts Keep Getting it Wrong	3	Book	Copyright	2009	0393065537	Preparing Managers to Manage	<p> The time has come to recognize that higher education in management rests on a fatal fallacy. The idea behind the contemporary business school is that preparing future business managers means training them in a discipline called Business Management. After 100 years of fruitless attempts to produce such a discipline, it should be clear that it does not exist. Preparing managers to manage, in fact, is not different from preparing people to live in a civilized world. Managers do not need to be trained; they need to be <em>educated.</em> And for that purpose, although a certain amount of study of business-related subjects may prove useful, the business schools as they are presently constituted are at best superfluous. </p>	Matthew Stewart					2010-02-27T13:07:00-08:00		212	W.

If we look at moral development, for example, we find that an infant at birth has not yet been socialized into the culture's ethics and conventions: this is called the <strong>preconventional stage</strong>. It is also called <strong>egocentric</strong>, in that the infant's awareness is largely self-absorbed. But as the young child begins to learns its culture's rules and norms, it grows into the <strong>conventional stage</strong> of morals. This stage is also called <strong>ethnocentric</strong>, in that it centers on the child's particular group, tribe, clan, or nation, and it therefore tends to exclude those not of its group. But at the next major stage of moral development, the <strong>postconventional stage</strong>, the individual's identity expands once again, this time to include a care and concern for all peoples, regardless of race, color, sex or creed, which is why this stage is also called <strong>worldcentric</strong>. </p> <p> Thus, moral development tends to move from &#8216;me&#8217; (egocentric) to &#8216;us&#8217; (ethnocentric) to &#8216;all of us&#8217; (worldcentric)&#8212;a good example of the unfolding waves of consciousness. </p>	Ken Wilber					2008-10-19T09:28:50-07:00		228	Shambhala	Boston &amp; London	34	ken-wilber	Ken_Wilber	Wilber, Ken	Ken <strong>Wilber</strong>	integral-approach.html	integral-approach.html	the <span class='sourcetype'>Book</span> <cite class='majortitle'>the integral vision</cite>, <span class='city'>Boston &amp;amp; London</span>: <span class='publisher'>Shambhala</span>, <span class='datepublished'>2007</span>, page&nbsp;<span class='pages'>34</span>, ISBN&nbsp;<a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1590304756/portablewisdo-20' class='isbn'>1590304756</a> 	<span class='rights'>Copyright</span> &copy; <span class='datepublished'>2007</span> by <span class='rightsowner'>Ken Wilber</span>
